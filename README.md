# K-MEANS_IMPLEMENTATIONS
## Implementing and Comparing K-Means Clustering Algorithms

This task contains a whole exploration of the K-Means clustering algorithm implemented in Pure Python, Numpy, and Cython. Our goal is to compare these implementations in terms of execution time and memory usage to understand the trade-offs and performance benefits of each approach.

## Overview

The K-Means clustering algorithm is a widely used technique for data clustering problems. This project aims to explore the algorithm's implementation in three different environments:

- **Pure Python**: Utilizes Python's standard libraries.
- **Numpy**: Leverages Numpy arrays for efficient numerical computations.
- **Cython**: Employs Cython to compile Python code to C, offering potential speed-ups.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Memory Profiler
- Cython
- A C compiler (for Cython)

###The notebook is structured as follows:

- Introduction: Provides a brief overview of the K-Means algorithm.
- Implementations: Discusses the algorithm's implementation in Pure Python, Numpy, and Cython.
- Profiling: Details the profiling process for execution time and memory usage.
- Results and Analysis: Compares the performance of the three implementations.
- Conclusion: Summarizes findings and potential areas for further research.
